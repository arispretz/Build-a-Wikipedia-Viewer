# Build-a-Wikipedia-Viewer

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Front End" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

The MediaWiki software powers Wikipedia, and it helps you collect and organize knowledge and make it available to people.

Using the MediaWiki API, replicate the search function and random article function, similar to the example app above. You can use Wikipedia as your data source.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
